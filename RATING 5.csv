Review

"This is my second JBL GO Speaker. The first one i had purchased around 12 months back (Cricket Blue colour). JBL are known for their sound devices and they dont disappoint with this small but awesome product. Not too expensive, just about right size to carry in your pockets or can be used in car as a handsfree unit. Sound is too good, which a first timer will not expect looking at the size of the unit. this unit personifies ""big things come in small packages""..."
Its a vary good product. I was hesitating for its purchase because of its high prize. But after purchasing I apriciating this product. We can easily cary this product into pocket And it gives sound which is reachable to the audience of a big hall. I use it for my class teaching as a speaker. It runs at full volume for 2 hours after its fully charged. It automatically connected with priviously connected device. It is connected vary fast. Bluetooth connection is compatible with all devices. Sound quality is excellent. Thanks To JBL.
It's a surprise out of the box. Definitely nothing so compact can match this little box in terms of clarity and loudness. I have seen people talking about bias. My personal opinion why to expect bais with this little thing. It has acceptable bais anyways. Pros- - exceptional performance on Music where multiple instruments are playing. Nothing mixes up. - Battery 6 +hrs. - Vocals.
"I received this speaker yesterday. Very Quick delivery and good packaging. Pros: -At this price, the sound quality is superb. -Great Build quality with the rubberized body. -Very portable design. -Though it is understandably not so good at Bass, because of the limitations of size etc. But it is able to deliver decent enough Bass that is soothing to the ear. -The Bluetooth was very Quick to connect, and it didn't loose signal, even if I moved away or walked into another room. -Haven't tested the Mic yet. Cons: -The charging cable should have been a little longer. -Should have included the MicroSD and the USB Playback functionality."
"Undoubtedly amazing product. The sound quality matches that of the Bose. Build quality is very good. The quoting is soft rubber, feels good to hold in hand. Size =3 inch x 3 inch x 1.25 inch. For its size the sound quality and quantity is astonishing. Sounds as loud as half volume of a 4 speaker car stereo. Very crisp and clear sound. Very good battery life, lasts more than 2 hours. I'm very satisfied with the purchase."
"As portable as it gets with great sound. I wish the bass would be a little more, but it's already very strong, I don't want to nitpick here. :p If your laptop speaker is busted and if you have an AUX cable with jacks at both ends, you can use this as an external speaker. You can also connect your device to the GO, sit at a distance, plug your headphones into the go, and listen on your headphone while being away from your computer or laptop. Crazy!"
"Well this is a no brainer. The sound quality is good with clear high and low notes , loud enough to fill the room even when the AC is on and very easy connectivity. It gives great battery life(4-5 hours) and is very sturdy(it fell down a couple of times but as the outer coat is premium plastic(rubber feel) there is absolutely no damage. It's very versatile and user friendly. Thumbs up"
Got this little dynamite today (Red Colour)and it has exceeded beyond my expectations didnt expect such great sound from this little monster. U have got to give this credit after all its Jbl Sound clarity is awesome n bass depends on where u place it though very minimal.Its Size is really small. Under this price jbl has created a masterpiece. Got it for 1649(1rs extra given to delivery guy).dont compare with other portable speakers In this range its the best. So all d audiophiles out there get this without giving any extra thoughts Its simply d best n you wont regret it''
"Suprb product *** It has been completed 10 months with jbl go and I found no mistake at all , great sound with a perfect size and awsome look love my Jbl go. Don't think just buy it . Here few points which make use of jbl easy for you .... 1. It doesnt need to switch on bluetooth botton again after you have synchronised it once with your smartphone. 2. While charging do not listhin song it is GOOD for the battery . 3. It is best with the medium size room. 4. It has medium base . 5.The paint start removing after some months of use from corners so while placing it always look out for a plane n soft suface."
Ultimate sound..best for those who travel and love music. Worth buy as compare to other brands. You won't get this quality of sound in other bluetooth speaker. After using around 6 months. I am facing its automatic shutdown problem when played in full sound w/o VLC use connecting through mobile.
"Well it's all about knowing what's you want. Generally I'm not into head phones, and my laptop inbuilt speakers aren't really what I want them to be! The Jbl portable speaker allows me to play music in superior quality with highly filtered sounds. Trust that it's louder than its seems, base is good too. Suitable for a moderately big room. I choose quality. ??"
"The battery life is very good and so is the bluetooth distance. You get the speakers, USB cable and the manual in the box. Cloudtail is the best seller for this product. I bought the product for Rs.1843. Specs Battery charge time - 1.5 hours (600mAH) Speakers playback time - 4.5-5 hours Pros On time and and proper delivery Reliable product quality (battery life and sound clarity) Stylish product Call receive and reply when phone is connected (clarity is appreciable) Cons Small distortion at high volume Low power and audio output Short USB cable"
"Any one who are willing to take this jbl go portable speaker, just close ur eyes n take...i gifted dis to my grandpa... He stays in 3rd floor.. And believe it v can hear the sound even in the in the parking lot...vry good quality of sound in such a small device... I would recommend everyone who are planning to buy it ...u cn take it undoubtedly. One more info it doesn't work with a Bluetooth version below 3.0...fr dis u hv to buy an extra aux cable. It's vry awesome portable speaker... Go fr it...ul never regret."
"JBL, as the brand suggests, is quite a good product. Played it continuously for 5 hours, without charging. The sound quality is good too. A good buy in all. Edit 1 : After 1.5 years of usage, it is still going strong and playing too good."
"Less charging time,very good back up,killer look,very handy,very responsive,nice range and above all mind blowing sound...crystal clear. But be aware once when i visited jbl service centre at rajendra place new delhi,they didn't entertain online purchased product.just refused straightforwardly.whats that?"
Quite a favourite at our home. This little guy follows us around when we need some music. From the kitchen to the garden it's sound quality is very acceptable for its size and portability. A good purchase overall. Now let's see how long it lasts....
"Just one word.. Excellent.. Good sound quality for a portable speaker, handy and fits in your palms but sounds like a professional speaker while listening.. Very much value for the money spent. Attending calls through this speaker is also an awesome experiance. I will strongly recommend to GO for this JBL GO.."
"At this price point this is one of the most affordable portable speakers that you can buy. I wish they had given a hook/clip along with the product to clip it on to bags. There isn't a lot of bass, so if you want a meaty base sound, you should try one of JBLs larger models."
Good speaker for price. If you are thinking that you have a speaker already in your phone and would it be just matching up to that? Then you are wrong. Its far far better than iphone 6 speaker..like day or night difference. But you can't compare to this with top of the line speakers. Value for money. Inside only.
"The speaker is really loud and can be heard across rooms. The feel n grip is good , quality of product is good too . The bluetooth is good when you are in the same room as speaker is, connectivity starts dropsping slowly once u enter a different room but that's how Bluetooth technology range is. Got it for 1700rs and so this becomes a kickass deal :D"
"Good battery life, charges quick, pairing is super simple. It gets really LOUD for its size which I did not expect. Audio is muddy, highs are crisp, and the bass is satisfactory ( for its size it's more than you could ask for)"
"i will buy online only with my husband permission,but this jbl i bought without info to him, firstly iam in dount about his reaction, after JBL output when my husband saw.He shocked by the sound.he amazed to find the sound from such a small device.Great one,iam totallly happy buying it.good music and without any space occupying no confusing wires.easy to carry anywhere. thank you amazon"
"Amazing..as of now!!! Yeah the bass ain't good at very high volumes. The voices start to separate. But for the amount I.e 1700 bucks, it's a really good speaker. Connects to anything n everything and amazing battery. I hear my videos and songs on it n it still lasts a good 3.5 to 4 hours for me. I have using it for 3 days n till now I am happy with it."
"So being of great confusion before buying this product, I think everyone who likes reading review before buying a product would like to know about this Speaker if they're comparing it to others. First of all it has great value for money, in comparison to the sound quality and pocket size speaker, it has loud enough sound, not a party speaker though, it would be loud enough for an average sized room. I recommend it to anyone who would like a portable speaker with cheap price and good quality. Ordering another one for my brother as it is a product that everyone deserves to have."
A very good product for it's price. Sufficient to fill a small room with superior quality of sound. When playing on max. volume it is heard even at my kitchen which is 2 rooms away from it's location with very less attenuation. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a good quality wireless speakers which is not too costly. Cons: It is not good with base. But that's understandable as well. Without sub woofers it is packed with all other pros to provide superior quality sound experience to people for it's price.
It is the best Portable Bluetooth speaker at this price. Volume is seriosuly quite loud and clear. Youtube this if you wana know it for yourself. But VOLUME is really loud and clear. More than cheap stereo speakers.
"Guys, this is beast.... I feel my 5.1 creative sub woofers cant perform at this level. I am a big fan of JBL Headphone, earphone and sound bar, but never thought a small bluetooth speaker can perform at this level.. Amazing..... love you JBL.. Dont ever think twice just buy and enjoy..."
Absolutely fantastic speaker from JBL. I use it on my office desk and it creates good quality music. The pairing of the speaker with the phone is really simple and quick. The battery lasts for a solid couple of hours. You cannot find a better speaker at this price.
Guys the most amazing feature is when your bluetooth is connected to the jbl the input jack becomes an output jack ie you can connect it to ur bigger system. Hats off
"Unbelievable piece of gadget. Smaller than your palm. So small that you will find it difficult to locate in your home if the music isn't playing. But if playing, this will be the only thing seen in your house !"
"Quite a sound for small body. Clean and clear sound almost up to full volume which is easily enough to fill up a big room. This thing found it's perfect spot beside my bed for late night melodies just to get my sleep right. This sits just at a hand distance so that i can just switch it off and slide in to my sleep. Very convenient, loud enough, reasonable Bass for its size. Very much recommended for casual music listening. Not for people who expect music system kind of sound quality."
Value for money speaker. Sound quality is good. Lacks bit of bass though but that's okay keeping in mind it's size and price. Optimum for casual use. I would have given it 4 stars for it's performance but i had to lower my expectations from this speaker keeping im mind the price. If you want superior performance like for parties and if you could spare a few bucks then i would recommend buying JBL flip 2. But in this price range it's a decent speaker.
I am extremely happy with this product. I could not believe that this small device can be so great to produce a clear and great sound. It is a perfect for small parties. it is very easy to connect and very handy even it can go in a pocket. I would like to highly recommend this. Amazon was great in delivering this product on time and I am very happy with their service. Regards Prachi
"The speaker is very handy, and the rubberized finish is really good. The sound unexpectedly is quite loud and clear. Bass is ok, can't complain at this price range. Felt slight distortion when on full volume, but nothing much noticeable. 50% to 75% volume is most of the time enough for an average size room. Easily gets paired with my iPad, laptop and phones, no issues there."
"The speakers were fabulous, better than expectations... They're tiny, can fit in the palm.of.your hand, and lightweight, so its easy to take them anywhere and use them with any device having Bluetooth compatibility. The sound quality is wonderful, although there is no bass boost or subwoofer. All in all a great package at 1800/-"
I don't have aux facility for my car. So rather than going for 8000 bucks stereo mp3 player i went to this for my car. its nice. Sound quality is good. Call can also be received. now I am using this with my itunes-iphone combination. Its not waterproof.
"I was a bit sceptical about buying JBL Go. I saw a lot of comparison reviews on YouTube. Its only competitor is Logitech X100. Believe me, the brand speaks for itself. I got it for 1600/-. Bluetooth facility is awesome. Output is 3w. I read that the bass is not up to the mark. But given the size of the speaker its cool. Treble is loud enough to fill the room"
It is tried and tested brand plus model for me. It completely fit to my requirement of portable speaker. Sound quality is best in actual along with good build. It is good for around 150-200 sq ft room. Bluetooth connectivity is limited to 10-15 meter max. If there are lots of obstacles then it get disconnected sometime but I believe it is due to smaller range. Overall I can say good to go for this price range.
"This is awesome product, loved the volume level with this small speaker. The most additional functionality i liked is the clarity in calls. It's microphone is very good and noise cancelation is good"
It's shocking & mind boggling to hear such amazing sound details and crisp bass come out such a Tiny box.. I am a music freak and have bought many Bluetooth Speakers in the past too and this one is the best at the price that it's being sold at... !! The range of connectivity is pretty amazing and goes really far and the speaker is really loud too with out any jarring nice and clean pure music ??????
"Used it for a few days and its an excellent product. V good audio quality, easy to set up and use. Highly recommended. Also came with the excellent service from Amazon, quick delivery, good packaging, easy to use ordering interface."
VERY AWESOME THING....just love it always..its so unpredictable..so small but so awesome..the sound quality is just superb and no one can expect such a miracle at such a price..I didnt do any research on this category of portable bluetooth speakers but i can bet that you are never going to feel dissapointed after purchasing this one. Definitely you will be very happy after using it.
What a small but amazing piece of technology. Quality of sound is crisp and awesome. Must buy.
Very good speaker with bass for listening to music at half the cost of JBL Flip2 worth buying as long as it works. You may not get guarantee from JBL company for the same when it goes bad.
Great product! I had some trouble connecting to my Windows 7 laptop but I updated the Bluetooth driver from the manufacturer website and it connected seamlessly. Hope this helps!
"Me and many friends and relatives have bought the same product and absolutley LOVE the speaker. Affordable and powerful enough for our in house parties. For the first time for me, Only one out of the last one ordered seems to have a defect and i am returning that ONE. Guess i.ll see the promptness of amazon.in in that too. Everyone was very surprised at how quick and easy the ordering and delivery is for such a state of the art device . Kudos amazon.in and JBL"
"The JBL Bluetooth speaker is of very good quality. It delivers loud, clear audio and lasts for 4-5 hours. It has also good bass. First I got a defective piece which was not charging. Thanks to Amazon that they accepted the replacement and now I am able to enjoy the music."
I think its one of the best portable speakers which i orders for my room. Amazing Product. JBL always have a habit of winning customer satisfaction Price :- Most competitive from all online channels Delivery : Paid Rs.50 and the product was on door step the next day over experience with Amazon is just brilliant
"I love love these. This is my second quantity of this product. First one got misplaced while we were shifting our home so i bought exactly same thing again. It is so convenient to carry this one and fits easily into my Kitchen, bathroom and Super for camping too !!! The bass is excellent and sound quality is superb !! you won't be disappointed with this. Love love these JBL babies !!"
This small JBL portable speaker is actually very good considering the price it comes at. I wanted a portable speaker which I can use with my desktop for skype calling and for listening regular music in the car. It produces good sound for its size. Sounds good even at full volume. Do not expect very good bass levels from product of this price range.
"I am always very choosy wid headphones n speaker, this one I bought widout listening the output and trust me guys it actually is fantastic. The bass and treble are perfectly matched for ppl wid great taste in music n sound quality this lil box is just wat u need for a get set go trip"
The sound it produces is remarkably and surprisingly loud compared with the size. Though it does not produce the quality Bass effects but considering the size the sound quality is crystal clear. The battery output is good as it last for around 3 1/2 to 4 hours which is more than satisfactory. If you want to listen to the music on your laptop or on the mobile this product will surely exceed your expectation.
Guys this is an amazing product. Besides being a surprisingly fabulous speaker it also doubles up as Bluetooth connector when I connect this speaker with my JBL soundbar with an aux cable
The best product i hav ever seen...i had took it fr 1600rs n i would lik to say tat d clarity of sound n bass is tooo fab... N battery backup is also gud it takes hardly half n hour to get 100% n it runs upto 4hours continously... The size if d product is small its lik a matchbox u can easily keep it in ua pocket... Thank you Amezone for a quick delivery n gud product...
"Got this as a gift for my sister. It is exactly palm sized. Looks good, I got the orange one. The color slightly faded at the corners even though it is just 2 months old. But its still a great product. Superb sound quality and is very loud. Its a good buy."
"Price 1599 INR. This thing is crystal clear till about 80% volume, and only minor distortion occurs at 100%. But 70% volume is more than enough to fill a normal sized room, and at 100% it can be heard all over my 3 bedroom house. The quality is not audiophile level, but is definitely perfect to set the mood."
"This is really awesome Budget Portable Bluetooth speaker available in market. Got a good brand, Got amazing sound clarity and Bass. Just wonderful. If you are planning to buy this do not think twice just go for it."
Quite good for its size and price. Obviously not for audiophiles but enough for a small room. I read a lot of reviews which said connectivity is an issue. It took me all of 10 seconds. Worked like a charm. Bought it only yday so can't comment on battery.
Awesome! 5 stars! Excellent sound and ultimate bang for the buck! Buy it with your eyes closed if you are in the market for a BT speaker that won't break the bank.
"Excellent product, great value for money. The sound is very clear and the bass is the best in it's class of speakers. The deal on Amazon was well worth the buy. JBL sounds better than Logitech or Altec speakers. The added advantage to receive calls via the speaker while it's connected to the Bluetooth comes in very handy."
"This is a great value for money product. Its easy to carry it around, and good for the car, home parties or an open studio (good upto 1000 sq ft area). The rubber padding wont let the speaker slip from an inclined surface. The bass sound is fairly decent. It charges up quickly in couple of hours and lasts for good 5-6 hours at a stretch."
Good things come in small packages...!! This speaker just goes on to prove the point. Compact speaker with superb sound quality. The clarity of sound doesn't crack even on full volume. Bluetooth range is pretty decent. Look and feel of the product is really sturdy. What more to say..?? I will sum it up by saying that JBL go is definitely more than value for money and a must buy for people who travel a lot...!
"You won't believe the power that emanated from this little wonder! At least I didn't. At this price range I was settling for just a mere Bluetooth speaker, but this product surpassed expectations with pretty good vocal rendering. It would be awesome to have a comprehensive bass, but I guess with what one's getting one couldn't ask for more. Extremely happy. Also, delivery by Amazon was on point.the product reached me before the expected date."
"Great price, Good quality, No distortion, Very compact, Nice color choices, Good voice clarity even on bluetooth, Last for more than 5 hours, Light weight"
Excellent product. Buying a wireless speaker for first time on Amazon and this product is small but powerful and a very good range. A value for money purchase!!
At the given price these are the best speaker most portable good sound easy to use and carry anywhere a must but for people looking for basic bt speaker for a small room to enjoy good music
"Worth it. long lasting battery , small size , nice music quality and affordable price makes it a perfect buy. when i say nice quality means u can't expect much in this price range. Go grab it , better in a deal ."
Excellent . Loved it. Sound quality best and running time 4 hours. Calling on speaking works smoothly. Overall. Truely works.
So this happened. I was in a rooftop bar and didn't like their music. So I being out this little mofo and started playing my own trance. They never knew what hit'em. Most probably my hands while I was dancing madly on my own music
"Just now got my sexy jbl go speakers as per given date amazon is perfect really good packaging, paired jbl go with my samsung galaxy s7 edge and after that with iphone 5s within no time it got connected, the sound and the base was so cristal clear that I forgot the size of the speaker its so small and gets easily into my pockets well I m dam excited how further it goes. Go for jbl go friends."
One of the best purchases I have made from Amazon so far. I have been using this product for about 3 months and it is amazing. Connects to all bluetooth devices (including Macbook and ipod) and has very good range. Sound quality is really good and the volume is also quite loud. A good buy for a good price!
"This is the best speaker in such at such a good price... Sound quality is amazing, far better than what you can expect from such a small piece! This is definitely worth buying ! Buy from the seller - ""Cloudtail"" ...it is the best, ....I had got a duplicate piece earlier from ""DEALSCART""...but returned it n got a new one!"
Amazing sound quality. Very handy and very easy to use. Have no complaints whatsoever. It indeed is a good buy and is a product which is value for money.
"Given its small size, this speaker is bound to make surprise the moment its turned on. The voice quality is so rich that its like a treat to your ears.Amazingly compact and well-built. I bought it for under 2k and that price there are many other options available but trust me no other device can match the quality of sound output on the JBL-Go"
This speaker is crazy good. The audio quality is out of this world and the sound fills up a huge room. It is cheaper online than in the store.
Sound is clear and excellent though the sub bass sounds are not upto the mark. But one will love to use them with vocals and hip hop. Though sub bass sounds are not good (it is excepted from such a small device) but still do well with imagine dragons radioactive. :-)
Very good speakers to buy. Easy to connect to. And the best feature I felt was to dual way 3.5mm jack which outputs audio when connected via bluetooth. This allows connecting another audio device along with this speaker.
"The best bluetooth speaker below 2000. The JBL-Go has a very smooth bass which I did not see in any other bluetooth speaker including the sony ball ""Sony SRSBTV5"". I bought two, one for my sister and one for myself. My sister is a music lover and her iPhone6 is giving a less volume. With JBL-Go, she is enjoying a lot. Especially Ilayaraja songs at late nights."
The sound quality is very nice and strong. Bass is also good. Gives a backup of 4-5 hours on 100% volume of speakers and 80% of volume of your device. Design is handy and appealing. Charges fast in approximately 1 hour. I got it in sale so for me it's worth the money.
"A cute little box with sound power of big daddy level. Compared to the size and price its the best Bluetooth speaker you can get. The sound quality is just great. Furthermore it's so small, you can actually travel with it as it occupies very less space, such that it can even fit inside your pocket. To sum it up, its JBL for God's Sake."
sound.. ohh JBL u rock!! mindblowing.. battery backup is also good.. earlier i had a plan 2 buy logitech which 1 of my friend has.. but the decision to go 4 jbl go really worked.. everything iz outstanding especially when u connect call with it.. crisp and clear voice..
Sound very good size small but sexy easy to use and very good sound coming out when you wanna listen a song so it's very good highly recommend
Small and yet so effective! Love the speaker. Syncs well with the iPhone. Easy to setup. Love the colour. So convenient - can be carried everywhere - super light and great sound!
This is my first online purchase and it was a great experience with Amazon. Being a music lover i was able to choose the best i need for my daily need. Not that i am lazy to walk into a store and check the product but i hate when peole make faces when you trial different brands. JBL is the best and 5 stars to Amazon for delivering exact speakers as it appears in the pics.
Excellent sound and easy to set up and use. My 4 year old now adjusts sounds easily
"Super awesome sound. Very clear at loudest point also. Perfect for a 2 BHK flat. It's compatible with almost all the devices. Battery lasts long. Using for past 2 months now, no problem encountered."
"If you want to use it for small space it will definitely work for you.. It cannot be used outdoors only suitable in room ., best if your laptops speaker doesn't work out for you go for this product and enjoy :)"
This one is damn good. This one is like a baby DJ. 1. Dhamaka for the size 2. Good Battery Back-Up 3. Fits in Your Pocket 4. Purchase Wont Empty Your Pockets 5. Wireless Connectivity Just so smooth 6. Good Quality I love it Black and Expectations did not Lack. Cheers.
"Though the form factor is small the output is incredible. Flawless operation.. Best heard when you play 320 kbps songs. Made and received few phone calls, the clarity was just fine! Overall a great deal! Thoroughly satisfied with the product. All I can say is - Just go for it!"
Amazing product. A small dude but vitality of a warrior. Can be carried around easily. It simply goes into my purse while I am traveling and listening to music as I move along. Great voice quality. Makes musid go alive. I am have lit of fun with it around. Hope you have a similar experience!
Awesome product. Sound Quality is Very Good and Clear Fills the room with good and decent sound. Good build quality No vibration of the device even in full sound. Very Handy and always stays in my bag while travelling. Worth for money
Amazon delivery: 5* Product: 5* Sound seems loud enough for a pocket Bluetooth speaker. Quality of sound is good and matches JBL standards up to some extent. Battery works not more than 4-4:30 hours at full volume. But I think which is good enough. Go for it.
"Gifted this to my father for easy listening from mobile phone. He is really happy with the ease of use, sound clarity and volume. Recommend this product."
Awesome! My daughter sees cartoon very close to the system. So got this speaker to bring in some distance between the two. And it works!!!!
Very easy to use and one touch connect. Makers could have worked on the bass a lot of disturbance. I know this device is not for the ideal music listening but still could have done better.
"The JBL Go is truly a mind blasting bluetooth speaker with crisp sound and a mild base. The loudness of the speakers is enough for a big room. Overall this speaker is a perfect example of ""Chota Packet Bada Dhamaka"""
Don't underestimate the size of this speaker. Its a super duper hit ! Sound is amazing.... In fact you can have a party at your place with this. Simply amazing and i would surely recommend this to all the Music lovers out there.
Such a quality product I feel proud to own this after all its jbl product can not believe how lovely sound comes in this tiny speaker thx jbl thx amazon
"Its an awesome device to tune up ur music life.... The range of bluetooh is awesm.. The battery back up.. Speechless... Playing for almost 4hrs at full volume still no sign of battery low..... Basically about the sound which is the most mandatory specs to be discussed..... Firstly, baby its JBL! The sound perfectionist .... N diz small thing is a beast in sound"
"What to tell, everything is awesome when you go with JBL We can not expect more than this, Quality of the product, Sound is simply greatAwsome product"
The name is everything here yes JBL. it's the most awesome and perfect bn Bluetooth speaker I ever had...suggest must buy for low bugdeters
Sound quality is good Clear and crisp sound. Can feel awkward some times because sound is coming from some other place and the video is playing somewhere else
Great portable bluetooth speaker which delivers size defying sound. very able speaker that is very conveniently sized. Its a JBL.. enough said!
Quick pairing with both phone and laptop. Instruction manual is small and pictorial. But could figure out how to work it easily. Works as described.
It's a very nice product. Sound is very good. Range of Bluetooth is very good. I am easily able to listen music from other room where speaker was in the other area.
"Suprisingly amazed by the sound and bass this small box can bring out. Extremely happy with the buy and it is very easy to use and connect. If you are looking a small and handy speaker to be carried along with you always, i recommend you to throw your money on this."
Excellent product.. so compact .. sound quality is superb.. even minute sounds are discriminated well . Worth a buy for 2k rupees.. so easy to connect.. I am using this device in my car for attending voice calls . It is very clear for that ..
This is an amazing product. This is a perfect product for someone who is looking for a speaker to use regularly at home or for small gatherings. The sound clarity is crystal clear. the battery backup is excellent and also it is very handy size of ur palm.. Loving this speaker and using it everyday.
"I got this speaker today at 1650 and its really good, sound is good, quality is good, size is small, but this is what it is meant for....overall good. Just one thing is less, as its not waterproof and shock proof as atlec lancing is offering."
Wanted to have a decent bluetooth speaker. Did lot of research and finally selected this. Excellent sound quality and personalised sound. Good for 2 sitting together and watching tv or listening music. No need for second thought. Go ahead...
It has very clear and high sound. Good for those who work with youth groups or other programs. But sometimes it power off while playing music. And I felt difficult to conect with my computer. I am trying many time to connect to my computer. I give 5 star because the product is good.
"Great Product. I'm using this for making my group meeting with the clients. So either If I receive the Phone from client, or else we have Skype Call or Zoom Call, I can have this ON so that My team can also listen and communicate directly with the client. Superb. Recommended."
"Wow...just wow! Go for it man just buy it..worth every penny.Bass is amazing, treble is very good ,built quality is top knotch and connectivity is superb ...loved it"
I bet u can't get anything better than this mini monster at this price....it's the best...it's JBL. U do not have to read any reviews for buying this product..just buy it n m sure u will not regret
"Amazing, god-like quality for the sound that it provides. Has no issues with connecting to our devices and overall a great purchase."
It's been 3 hours of usage n I'm loving the product. One of the best sounds I have felt. Gr8 clarity no distortion n very high range. AND OF ALL VERRRRYYYYY LOUD AUDIO. I'm just in love with this. I was confused between JBL n Mi bt now my desision to buy this is looking pretty good
"The best Bluetooth speaker for its price .I compared it with the Mi speaker it which was 1.jarring a lot during play back 2.Vibrating the surface it was placed on 3.Costs 2500 ,I bought the JBL GO for 1800."
Excellent as is to be expected fo a JBL product. Small enough to be carried anywhere and loud enough for fairly large rooms. Great product.

"Excellent product from jbl,I got it worth of 1899 ,good quality sound,easy to take everywhere Thanks 2amazon"
"I had tried many BT speakers like Philips BT64R and soundboat etc. Those speakers are obviously cheaper n louder than Jbl, no doubt. At 100% volume those start irritating badly, music turns into noice. But it can never beat the sound quality of JBL.worth every penny spent. Recommend it ."
It's a really good portable speaker. The sound can go really loud n the clarity is fantastic. Looks wise its supurb n has really bright colour. I ordered pink. I will definitely recommend it. My aunt was so impressed by it that she even ordered one for herself.
"JBL is the beast. Louder than expected (keeping in mind its size). Not to mention, an awesome battery back-up (about 4-5 hours in full sound and about 6-7 hours in mild sound). Worth the price. Totally in love with this product."
Truely aweaome product.. Clear Voice n Steardy body n finishing.. looks nice n gives superr out put.. batt life also last long.. getz charge in leas tym.. definately go for it.. Bingo JBL n AMAZON fr Quick delivery

"Loved it! Bought it for my dad, 70+ years. He too loved it. He can hear clear and loud audio let it be a call, a video from Youtube or his fave songs stored in his phone."
Good electronic product at this price. Sound is good. Battery backup us too good.. distance range is also appreciatied....
It's a lovely product who strenthens the saying that all good things come in small packages.excellent audio quality delivered at great price. JBL once again proved its mettle. Its easy to operate and manage.
"Regret on why did i take so long in purchasing this device! Amazed me to see such a small product sound so very good; also the volume is loud enough to travel to my living room from my bedroom. Great device to carry with you on road trips, picnics."

This is my second JBL Go. Great product. Battery lasts the whole day. I also use it in the car as a handsfree. FYI does not have data card port or FM mode.
"""Good stuff comes in small packages."" No not drugs ofcourse ??... But this tiny speaker sounds truly amazing. The sound is crystal clear, even at highest volume. Just go for it!"
Awesome sound quality. Could not expect this small device can produce such quality and loudness. Brilliant work Herman.
Worth it! It gives good and clear sound. When I place the JBL Go in my Kitchen and my laptop in my drawing room (which has 2 walls in between) still the songs play but when I walk across there is interruption.
If you have a loud listen music then don't buy this product because this speakers sound is a quality sound.
Excellent sound and compact size. I use this for my teleconference calls. It's really loud and super easy to connect.
"at first when i received product, i felt disappointed after looking at size but as soon as i played it. it was beyond my expectation. Sound and base is on par. simply loved the speaker. Also, finishing of the product is really awesome and it looks quite elegant when we hold in our hand."
Great sound. The power/usb cable is short. Could have been a little more lengthy to allow proper placement of speaker while charging. But great sound for the small size. And great deal at Amazon.
Great sound for such a small piece. Good for hikking and trekking trips. Nice back up Good ergonomic body and nice matte finish Easy to connect.

I love it so much amazing powerful sound in such a small size it is perfect in everything but it just misses a battery indicator that's the only con i can think about it. I would say it as money well spent on a worthy item :)

"Portable boom sound, good bass..battery lasts long..great to listen to music while travelling, camping.."
An excellent product from JBL. Quite satisfied with the Amazon delivery and product performance. Sound quality is exceptional both at high and low volumes.
There may be other BT speakers but they cannot beat this when it comes to the Speaker Phone function. Great for quickly having a conference call with the mic effectively picking up voices of those sitting around a table.
"So compact and light-weighted to carry, designing and execution of operating soft-key buttons and ports are superb! Sound and bass quality is just simply amazing considering the size of speaker. If you are out looking for compact speaker for your room or writing table JBL GO would be best buying option."
"Though they are really small in size according to what we see in the picture.... But the sound quality is amazing !! And it has just the volume that is needed for listening to music indoors, not less, not more!!"
"Good product, they can now reduce the price as number of buyer are more now."

Jbl means 5 star only. That is coz of their consistent quality . Size is too small but performance is too god. Its too handy.. but it could hav been better of there was an indicator for charge left out. Sound clarity too good even in high sound.
"Cute little speaker from a solid brand. Connects quickly and plays well. No cables to fiddle and a child can set it up! Besides, great price! ??"
"amazing sound and clarity, all neatly packed into a small box...easy to carry it arount...good battery backup..."

"Compact size, good quality sound, good range (works best in LOS of phone). Happy with the purchase."
"Incredible! The sound quality is phenomenal and the bass is impressive. JBL nails it with this product. Also, the MRP of the product is listed somewhere at 3200 so Amazon is providing the product at an fabulous price."
Excellent value for money. Well made with a very decent sound though I found it a tad bass heavy. With a brand like JBL and a decent pricetag worth it. Don't expect an audiophile sound though.
"One of the best thing I bought from Amazon. The package quality was optimum. I am using since last 3 months and not a single issue. Best suitable for indoor use. At last, it is worth 2000.."
"Wonderful product from JBL. It is a very handy product, sound quality is good. I would recommend this little beast to those who want to buy handy Bluetooth speaker."
